        <p>
          I am a husband, father, son, brother, friend, and professional. I have 14 years of experience as a public school teacher
          in addition to 10 years as a Drama Director/Producer and Music Director. Currently, I am employed as a Client Experience
          Manager at MRI Software in Solon, OH. In this role, I employ multiple skill sets, such as product customization,
          client retention initiatives, project coordination, and much more. Since the summer of 2016, I have been constantly
          honing,and adding to, my coding skills. I have 2 years of experience as a Web Developer (both front and back end),
          as shown by my Online AP Music Theory Prep Course. My coding competencies include: HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL, Node.js,
          AngularJS, Angular2, AJAX, php, jQuery, and React.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a dedicated professional, I am continuously committed to my own personal and professional development that has groomed
          me in technology skills that I combine with my exceptional educational talent. My ability to provide exceptional
          project management and guidance and design together my passion for technology and commitment to business, operational,
          and team leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have exceptional talents for bringing together others to support development and artist efforts through engagement
          and funding support management. The most notable example of this is my development and management of an interactive
          website as leader of AP Music Theory Prep Course, providing formatted interfaces for teachers and students to learn
          music theory through self-taught instruction.
